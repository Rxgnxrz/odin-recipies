# odin-recipies
In the current project I have created a page using HTML only where you can view different recipies with description and steps on how to prepare it.

As a reflection I have implemented my new knowledge on HTML using the different tags we have available as well as implementing the good usage of git by adding the different commits during the construction of the project.
